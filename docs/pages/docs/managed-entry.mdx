# Managed Entry

Pilot.js comes with a managed entry point that you can use to get started quickly. This is the recommended way to get started with Pilot.js.

Edit your `app.json` to include the following:

```json:app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "entryPoint": "node_modules/@waveplay/pilot/AppEntry.js"
  }
}
```

This will automatically load your environment variables and render the `PilotArea` component on your behalf so you can focus on your pages as your would with Next.js.

## Custom entry

You're still free to use your own entry point if you prefer. This is useful if you want to customize the `<PilotArea>` component or if you want to use Pilot.js with a different framework.

Make sure you're calling `loadEnv()` and rendering the `<PilotArea>` component otherwise Pilot.js won't work as expected.

```tsx:AppEntry.js
import { loadEnv } from '@waveplay/pilot/env'
import { PilotArea } from '@waveplay/pilot/ui'

// Loads public environment variables
loadEnv()

const App = () => {
	// ... your code

	return (
		<PilotArea/>
	)
}
export default App
```

> **Good to know:** Remember that this file only runs on the native runtime. You can't use any Next.js features here.

## Managed document

Similar to the managed entry point, a managed _document is also provided. It bootstraps the stylesheet to match React Native behavior.

Projects created with `create-pilot-app` will automatically use this document by default. It basically just exports the default document from Pilot.js like so:

```tsx:pages/_document.tsx
export { default } from '@waveplay/pilot/document'
```

If you'd like to use your own document but still want the stylesheet bootstrapped, you can either [copy the source code](https://github.com/Wave-Play/pilot/blob/main/packages/pilot/document.js) or you can import `getInitialProps` and assign it to your own document:

```tsx:pages/_document.tsx
import NextDocument from 'next/document'
import { getInitialProps } from '@waveplay/pilot/document'

export class Document extends NextDocument {
	// ...
}

Document.getInitialProps = getInitialProps
export default Document
```

> **Good to know:** Using the managed document has issues with the new [transpilePackages](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/compiler#module-transpilation) feature in Next.js 13. Either continue using [next-transpile-modules](https://github.com/martpie/next-transpile-modules) for this or copy the source for [_document.js](https://github.com/Wave-Play/pilot/blob/main/packages/pilot/document.js) into your project.
