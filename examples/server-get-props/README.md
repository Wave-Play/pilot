<h1 align="center">Basic Example</h1>

This is a simple TypeScript project using NextJS and Expo to show how well Pilot works across all platforms.

## Usage

First things first, install dependencies.

```bash
yarn install
```

To run this example on the web:

```bash
yarn start:next
```

To run this example on native:

```bash
yarn start:expo
```

You can run both `start:next` and `start:expo` at the same time.
