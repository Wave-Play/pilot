# Command Line Interface

Pilot.js provides a built-in command line interface (CLI) to help you develop and build your app. It exposes a few commands necessary for development and production.

## Commands

The following commands are available:

### build

The `build` command will prepare your project. You **must** run this before you can start your app otherwise features such as routing and environment variables may not work as expected.

```bash:Terminal
pilot build
```

Options:

`--no-env` (alias `-ne`) - Skip loading environment variables
`--silent` (alias `-s`) - Do not print anything to the console
`--verbose` (alias `-v`) - Print more information to the console

### dev

The `dev` command will start a development server on native + web.

```bash:Terminal
pilot dev
```

This will:

1 Start a Next.js development server
2 Build Pilot.js & link to your local Next.js server
3 Start an Expo development server

Options:

`--no-env` (alias `-ne`) - Skip loading environment variables
`--hostname <hostname>` (alias `-H`) - Specify the hostname to use for the Next.js server
`--port <port>` (alias `-p`) - Specify the port to use for the Next.js server
`--silent` (alias `-s`) - Do not print anything to the console
`--tunnel` (alias `-t`) - Create a local tunnel to your development Next.js server
`--verbose` (alias `-v`) - Print more information to the console

> **Note:** Tunneling is useful if you're having trouble connecting to your development server or you're developing on a device that is not on the same network as your computer. It will create a public URL that you can use to access your development server.

You will need to install [`localtunnel`](https://localtunnel.me/) to use this feature.

### sync:locales

Only necessary if you're using the `i18n` feature and don't have [Web Props](/docs/web-props) enabled. This command will bundle your locale files from `/public/locales` into your native app and generate static imports for internal use.

Options:

`--silent` (alias `-s`) - Do not print anything to the console
`--verbose` (alias `-v`) - Print more information to the console

> **Note:** Learn more about [Internationalization](/docs/i18n).
